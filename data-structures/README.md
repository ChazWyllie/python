# Data Structures Study
A collection of data structure implementations, notes, and practice problems

## 1. Introduction
I created this repo to deepen my knowledge of fundamental data structures and to have a personal reference for future projects or interviews.

Each folder includes:
- **README.md**: Explanation of the data structure, usage examples, and complexity.
- **Implementation file(s)**: Code implementing the data structure and tests/examples.
